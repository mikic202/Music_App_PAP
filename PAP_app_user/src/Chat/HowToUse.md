Chat class has one constructor and to work it needs to take in socket connected to the server, user_id and current_conv_id(for now it has to be one of conversations). There are 8 public methods and their names describe their functionalities quite well.
When you change the conversation you need to activate set_current_conversation method to change which conversation is open. If you don't do that other methods won't work correctly. If you want to load messages you need to use get_current_messages method and it will return ArrayList of messagesa as JSONObjects. Each one of those JSONObject has five fields: message_id, sender_id, conversation_id, timestamp and text. Most of the others methods also return JSONObjects
